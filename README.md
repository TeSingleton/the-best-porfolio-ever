# the-best-portfolio-ever

A potential candidates awesome portfolio page.
More so a demo of techniques learned
in the first couple weeks of my bootcamp.
This is a mock up that will be changed and adjusted overtime.

My goal was to have a floating Nav on the side of the page that
disappeared when the screen size became compressed.
I wanted my work in a scrolling element in the center of the page.
As I am still working on retaining the concepts learned,
I have not fully completed the assignment,
but I am confident that i can update this project and resubmit for a better score at a later date.
